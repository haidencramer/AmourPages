                    <p>
                        Nate Heim was assigned as our scrum master and helped us figure out a good plan from the start on how to make our idea a reality.
                        He developed the matching algorithm, and also helped make sure everyone hit their deadlines and assigned tasks. Haiden did a lot of the CSS and Javascript
                        found across the website so we could make sure it looked pretty because it's a dating website, and also helped solve other issues with the backend. Colin created most of the different views, models, profile templates, and also helped
                        a lot with the backend. All in all we each spent a decent amount of time in different areas helping each other out and it made us way better programmers in the process.

                    <p>
                      After going through many different ideas for a cool web application we decided to create a dating app called Amour.
                      With Amour you are able to set up a profile using login and a signup form as well as edit your profile! We have a functionality that allows
                      users to upload profile pictures, add more information about themselves, complete a survey to find matches, view a dashboard of their profile information, and overall the website looks very clean.
                      In the future we would like to add a chat implementation and currently it's a work in progress. Although there were many challenges faced along the way 
                      We learned a lot about time management and working in a group on an web application .We hope you enjoy our project and see what it had to offer.
